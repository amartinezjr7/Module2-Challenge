# Module2-Challenge
Repository for my 2nd Challenge submission
I found myself getting a little too invested in the css and the styling that i wasn't quite able to finish.
What i was able to accomplish was a decent web page where all the links work and the format is identical to the mock up.
My only struggle was constantly changing my HTML to where it would be most fluid. I reset everything a couple of times because i
was't satisfied with the architecture. 

I was able to create the different section that were required by the mock up. 

Create links that take you to the sections specified. 

create a more dynamic code (although i didn't quite like the pictures to I didn't include them)

I was not able to create a link to some of my projects though.

I will resubmit this project again once i feel great about the outcome.
